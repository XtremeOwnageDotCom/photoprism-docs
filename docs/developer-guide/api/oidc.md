# Single Sign-On via OpenID Connect

[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) extends [OAuth 2.0](oauth2.md) to allow users to log in and optionally register through an external identity provider instead of manually entering a username and password:

| PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_WEBDAV   | --oidc-webdav   |                    | allow new OpenID Connect users to use WebDAV when they have a role that allows it                   |
| PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_OIDC  | --disable-oidc  |                    | disable single sign-on via OpenID Connect, even if an identity provider has been configured         |

!!! example ""
    Your PhotoPrism instance and the [OpenID Connect Identity Provider (IdP)](#identity-providers) must be accessible **via HTTPS** and have valid TLS certificates configured for it. Please also make sure that the hostname in the [Redirect URL](#redirect-url) configured on the IdP matches the [Site URL](../../getting-started/config-options.md#site-information) used by PhotoPrism. Single sign-on via OIDC can otherwise not be enabled.

## Identity Providers

To authenticate users via OIDC, you can either set up and use a self-hosted identity provider such as [ZITADEL](https://zitadel.com/docs/self-hosting/deploy/compose) or [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), or configure e.g. one of the following public identity providers:

- [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
- [Microsoft](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
- [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/login-with-amazon)

Single sign-on can be configured automatically if [Identity Providers](#identity-providers) offer a standardized `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint for [service discovery](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#well-known-oauth-authorization-server), for example:

- <https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration>

### Local Development

Our [development environment](../setup.md) comes with a [pre-configured Keycloak](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/compose.yaml#L217-L243) OIDC Identity Provider running at <https://keycloak.localssl.dev/> for local testing:

- <https://keycloak.localssl.dev/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration>

An `admin` account for managing users and a `user` account for testing single sign-on are pre-registered. Both have the password `photoprism`.

!!! example ""
    Please do not use this test identity provider in a production environment as its configuration is not secure.

## Redirect URL

The Redirect URL that must be [specified when registering a new client](img/redirect-url-example.jpg) with an [Identity Provider](#identity-providers) is as follows, where `{hostname}` must be replaced by the hostname in the [Site URL](../../getting-started/config-options.md#site-information), e.g. configured via `PHOTOPRISM_SITE_URL`:

```
https://{hostname}/api/v1/oidc/redirect
```

Both URLs must begin with `https://` to use HTTPS, as otherwise single sign-on via OIDC cannot be enabled.

## Preferred Username

When a new user signs in with OpenID Connect[^1], their preferred username may already be registered. In this case, a random 6-digit number is appended to resolve the conflict.

The config option `PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_USERNAME` allows you to change the [preferred username](#config-options) for new accounts from `preferred_username` to `name`, `nickname`, or verified `email`. Names are changed to lowercase handles so that, for example, "Jens Mander" becomes "jens.mander".

!!! example ""
    Advanced users can connect an existing account by manually updating the `auth_id` column to match the subject ID of the OIDC provider and changing the value of the `auth_provider` column to `oidc` in the `auth_users` database table, and then deleting the duplicate account so only one user with a matching `auth_id` remains.

## Service Discovery

It is not yet possible to use PhotoPrism as an [Identity Provider](#identity-providers), since not all the required [endpoints](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/4368) and [grant types](oauth2.md) have been fully implemented.

However, querying the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint shows what has already been implemented, so the missing capabilities can be identified and added over time:

- <https://demo.photoprism.app/.well-known/openid-configuration>
