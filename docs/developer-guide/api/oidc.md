# OpenID Connect

## Single Sign-On

[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) extends [OAuth 2.0](oauth2.md) with [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#userinfo) functionality, allowing users to log in and optionally register via OIDC instead of manually entering a username and password:

| PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_URI      | --oidc-uri      |                    | identity provider issuer `URI` for single sign-on via OpenID Connect, e.g. "https://accounts.google.com" |
| PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_CLIENT   | --oidc-client   |                    | client `ID` for single sign-on via OpenID Connect                                                        |

| PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_PROVIDER | --oidc-provider |                    | custom identity provider `NAME`, e.g. "Google"                                                           |

| PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_REDIRECT | --oidc-redirect |                    | automatically redirect unauthenticated users to the configured identity provider                         |
| PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_REGISTER | --oidc-register |                    | allow new users to create an account when they sign in with OpenID Connect                               |
| PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_USERNAME | --oidc-username | preferred_username | preferred username `CLAIM` for new OpenID Connect users (preferred_username, email, nickname)            |
| PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_WEBDAV   | --oidc-webdav   |                    | allow new OpenID Connect users to use WebDAV when they have a role that allows it                        |
| PHOTOPRISM_DISABLE_OIDC  | --disable-oidc  |                    | disable single sign-on via OpenID Connect, even if an identity provider has been configured              |

!!! example ""
    Your PhotoPrism instance and the [OpenID Connect Identity Provider (IdP)](#identity-providers) must be accessible **via HTTPS** and have valid TLS certificates configured for it. Please also make sure that the hostname in the [Redirect URL](#redirect-url) configured on the IdP matches the [Site URL](../../getting-started/config-options.md#site-information) used by PhotoPrism. Single sign-on via OIDC can otherwise not be enabled.

### Redirect URL

The Redirect URL that must be [specified when registering a new client](img/redirect-url-example.jpg) with an [Identity Provider](#identity-providers) is as follows, where `{hostname}` must be replaced by the hostname in the [Site URL](../../getting-started/config-options.md#site-information), e.g. configured via `PHOTOPRISM_SITE_URL`:

```
https://{hostname}/api/v1/oidc/redirect
```

Both URLs must begin with `https://` to use HTTPS, as otherwise single sign-on via OIDC cannot be enabled.

### Preferred Username

When a new user tries to sign in via OpenID Connect, this may fail because the preferred username is already registered and there is no automatic conflict resolution or *Connect Account* flow implemented yet.

In this case, it may help to [change the username preference](#config-options) from `preferred_username` to `email` or `nickname` with the `PHOTOPRISM_OIDC_USERNAME` config option.

Alternatively, advanced users can connect an existing account by manually updating the `auth_id` column to match the subject ID of the OIDC provider and changing the value of the `auth_provider` column to `oidc` in the `auth_users` database table.

## Service Discovery

### Client Configuration

Single sign-on via OIDC can be configured automatically if [Identity Providers](#identity-providers) offer a standardized `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint for [service discovery](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#well-known-oauth-authorization-server), for example:

- <https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration>

### Server Endpoint

It is not yet possible to use PhotoPrism as an [Identity Provider](#identity-providers), since not all the required [endpoints](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/4368) and [grant types](oauth2.md) have been fully implemented.

However, querying the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint shows what has already been implemented, so the missing capabilities can be identified and added over time:

- <https://demo.photoprism.app/.well-known/openid-configuration>

## Identity Providers

To authenticate users via OIDC, you can either set up and use a self-hosted identity provider such as [ZITADEL](https://zitadel.com/docs/self-hosting/deploy/compose) or [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), or configure e.g. one of the following public identity providers:

- [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect)
- [Microsoft](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
- [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app)
- [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/apps-and-games/login-with-amazon)

### Local Development

Our [development environment](../setup.md) comes with a [pre-configured Keycloak](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/blob/develop/compose.yaml#L217-L243) OIDC Identity Provider running at <https://keycloak.localssl.dev/> for local testing:

- <https://keycloak.localssl.dev/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration>

An `admin` account for managing users and a `user` account for testing single sign-on are pre-registered. Both have the password `photoprism`.

!!! example ""
    Please do not use this test identity provider in a production environment as its configuration is not secure.
