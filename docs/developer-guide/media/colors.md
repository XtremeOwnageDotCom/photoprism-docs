# Color Profiles

## Standard RGB

[sRGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRGB) is the default color space used for [generating thumbnails](thumbnails.md). PhotoPrism and browsers assume this color space for images that do not have an embedded ICC color profile.

## ICC Profiles

An [ICC color profile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_profile) that characterizes the color space being used can optionally be embedded in image and video files. For color profiles other than sRGB and Display P3, the thumbnails must be generated with `libvips` by setting the `PHOTOPRISM_THUMB_LIBRARY` config option to `vips` or `auto` so that the [ICC profiles are preserved](https://github.com/photoprism/photoprism/issues/1474): 

|          Environment           |       CLI Flag        | Default |                                         Description                                          |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PHOTOPRISM_THUMB_LIBRARY       | --thumb-library       | auto    | image processing `LIBRARY` to be used for generating thumbnails (auto, imaging, vips)        |
| PHOTOPRISM_THUMB_COLOR         | --thumb-color         | auto    | standard color `PROFILE` for thumbnails (auto, preserve, srgb, none)                         |

Image colors may otherwise not be displayed correctly, which is particularly noticeable with ProPhoto RGB and Adobe RGB, as these cover a wide range of colors:

## Color Detection

Color detection is performed during indexing using a 3x3 thumbnail that covers the top, bottom and center of an image e.g. <https://demo.photoprism.app/library/browse?color=green>.
