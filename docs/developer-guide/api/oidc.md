# OpenID Connect

## Single Sign-On

[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) extends [OAuth 2.0](oauth2.md) with [Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#userinfo) functionality, allowing users to log in and optionally register via OIDC instead of manually entering a username and password:

!!! example ""
    Note that your PhotoPrism instance and the OpenID Connect Identity Provider must use HTTPS, otherwise single sign-on via OIDC cannot be enabled.

## Service Discovery

### Client Configuration

Single Sign-On via OpenID Connect can be configured automatically if Identity Providers offer a standardized `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint for [service discovery](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#well-known-oauth-authorization-server):

- <https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration>
- <https://keycloak.localssl.dev/realms/master/.well-known/openid-configuration>

### Server Endpoint

It is not yet possible to use PhotoPrism as an OIDC Identity Provider, since not all the required standards and grant types have been fully implemented. However, querying the `/.well-known/openid-configuration` endpoint will show what is already in place, so the remaining functionality can be identified and added over time as needed:

- <https://demo.photoprism.app/.well-known/openid-configuration>
