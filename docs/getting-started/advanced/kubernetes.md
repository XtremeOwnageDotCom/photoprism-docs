# Running PhotoPrism with Kubernetes

*While we believe this contributed content may be helpful to advanced users, we have not yet thoroughly reviewed it. If you have suggestions for improvement, please let us know by clicking :material-file-edit-outline: to submit a change request.*

At a minimum, you can just define a Kubernetes `Service` and a `StatefulSet` and be up and running. For more real-world usage, you'll probably want to at least include persistent storage, and possibly some `Ingress` rules for exposing PhotoPrism outside your cluster.

Before you proceed, please ensure that your server has [at least 4 GB of swap](../troubleshooting/docker.md#adding-swap) configured and avoid setting a [hard memory limit](../faq.md#why-is-my-configured-memory-limit-exceeded-when-indexing-even-though-photoprism-doesnt-actually-seem-to-use-that-much-memory) as this can cause unexpected restarts when the indexer temporarily needs more memory to process large files. Indexing RAW images and high-resolution panoramas may require additional [swap space](../troubleshooting/docker.md#adding-swap) and/or physical memory beyond the [recommended minimum](../index.md#system-requirements).

For those familiar with [Helm](https://helm.sh), a PhotoPrism Helm chart [is available](https://github.com/p80n/photoprism-helm).

Once you've got PhotoPrism deployed, you can `exec` into the running container and `photoprism import` your photos.

Here's an [example of a YAML file](../../developer-guide/technologies/yaml.md) that creates the following Kubernetes objects:

- `Namespace`
- `Service` exposing PhotoPrism on port 80
- `StatefulSet` with persistent NFS volumes
- `Secret` which stores the database DSN and admin password
- `Ingress` rule for a Kubernetes [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/)
- Annotations for a Kubernetes [`Certificate Manager`](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager)

To run this locally, you can use [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
or a similar local cluster deployer.

Once your cluster is up and running with your `kubectl` commands. Simply copy the above YAML
markup to a file, make the necessary changes, and use the `kubectl` CLI command to deploy:

```bash
kubectl create -f photoprism.yaml
```

If you prefer to use helm, see https://github.com/p80n/photoprism-helm.
